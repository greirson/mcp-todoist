# Todoist MCP Server
[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@greirson/mcp-todoist)](https://smithery.ai/server/@greirson/mcp-todoist)

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects Claude with Todoist for complete task and project management through natural language.

## Quick Start

1. Install: `npm install -g @greirson/mcp-todoist`
2. Get your [Todoist API token](https://todoist.com/app/settings/integrations)
3. Add to Claude Desktop config with your token
4. Ask Claude: *"Show me my Todoist projects"*

**That's it!** You can now manage your Todoist tasks directly through Claude.

## Installation & Setup

### Installing via Smithery

To install mcp-todoist for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@greirson/mcp-todoist):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @greirson/mcp-todoist --client claude
```

### Step 1: Install the Package
```bash
npm install -g @greirson/mcp-todoist
```

### Step 2: Get Your Todoist API Token
1. Log in to your [Todoist account](https://todoist.com)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations**
3. Scroll down to the **Developer** section
4. Copy your **API token** (keep this secure!)

### Step 3: Configure Claude Desktop

Add the server to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**On macOS/Linux:**
- File location: `~/.config/claude_desktop_config.json`

**On Windows:**
- File location: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "todoist": {
      "command": "mcp-todoist",
      "env": {
        "TODOIST_API_TOKEN": "your_api_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**⚠️ Important:** Replace `your_api_token_here` with your actual Todoist API token from Step 2.

### Step 4: Restart Claude Desktop

Close and reopen Claude Desktop to load the new MCP server.

### Step 5: Verify Installation

In Claude Desktop, try asking:
```
"Show me my Todoist projects"
```

You should see a list of your Todoist projects, confirming the integration is working!

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No Todoist projects found" or connection errors:**
- Verify your API token is correct
- Check that the token is properly set in your claude_desktop_config.json
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or quotes around your token

**MCP server not loading:**
- Confirm the package is installed globally: `npm list -g @greirson/mcp-todoist`
- Restart Claude Desktop completely
- Check the configuration file path is correct for your operating system

**Permission errors:**
- On macOS/Linux, you may need to create the config directory: `mkdir -p ~/.config`
- Ensure Claude Desktop has permission to read the config file

## Usage Examples

### Project & Section Setup
```
"Show me all my projects"
"Create a new project called 'Work Tasks'"
"Create a section called 'In Progress' in project 12345"
"Show me sections in the Work Tasks project"
```

### Task Creation & Management
```
"Create task 'Team Meeting' in project 12345"
"Add task 'Review PR' due tomorrow with labels ['Code Review', 'Urgent']"
"Create high priority task with deadline 2024-12-25"
"Update meeting task to be in section 67890"
"Mark the PR review task as complete"
```

### Bulk Operations
```
"Create multiple tasks for project launch: 'Design mockups', 'Write documentation', 'Set up CI/CD'"
"Update all high priority tasks to be due next week"
"Complete all tasks containing 'review' in project 12345"
"Delete all tasks with priority 1 that are overdue"
```

### Comment Management
```
"Add comment 'This needs urgent attention' to task 'Review PR'"
"Add comment with attachment to task 67890"
"Show all comments for task 'Team Meeting'"
"Get comments for project 12345"
```

### Task Discovery
```
"Show all my tasks"
"List high priority tasks due this week"
"Get tasks in project 12345"
```

## Getting Started Workflow

### 1. First Steps
```
"Show me all my Todoist projects"
"Create a new project called 'Claude Integration Test'"
```

### 2. Basic Task Management
```
"Create a task 'Try out MCP integration' in my Inbox"
"Add a high priority task 'Review project setup' due tomorrow"
"Show me all my tasks"
```

### 3. Advanced Organization
```
"Create a section called 'In Progress' in my work project"
"Move the setup task to the In Progress section"
"Add a comment 'This is working great!' to my test task"
```

### 4. Bulk Operations
```
"Create multiple tasks: 'Plan meeting agenda', 'Prepare slides', 'Send invites'"
"Complete all tasks containing 'test' in the Claude project"
"Update all high priority tasks to be due next week"
```

## Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic task creation and project viewing
- **Use Natural Language**: Ask questions as you normally would
- **Leverage Bulk Operations**: Use bulk tools when working with multiple tasks
- **Organize First**: Set up projects and sections before creating many tasks
- **Regular Cleanup**: Use bulk operations to clean up completed or outdated tasks
