## Architecture

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates Claude with the Todoist API. The codebase has been modularized into a well-structured architecture.

### Key Components

- **MCP Server**: Uses `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` for MCP protocol implementation
- **Todoist Integration**: Uses `@doist/todoist-api-typescript` client library
- **Transport**: Runs on stdio transport for communication with MCP clients

### Modular Architecture

The codebase is organized into focused modules:

- **`src/index.ts`**: Main server entry point with request routing
- **`src/types.ts`**: TypeScript type definitions and interfaces
- **`src/type-guards.ts`**: Runtime type validation functions
- **`src/tools.ts`**: MCP tool definitions and schemas
- **`src/handlers/`**: Business logic handlers separated by domain:
  - `task-handlers.ts` - Task CRUD operations and bulk operations
  - `project-handlers.ts` - Project and section operations
  - `comment-handlers.ts` - Comment creation and retrieval operations
  - `test-handlers.ts` - Testing infrastructure for API validation and performance monitoring
- **`src/errors.ts`**: Custom error types with structured error handling
- **`src/validation.ts`**: Input validation and sanitization
- **`src/cache.ts`**: Simple in-memory caching for API optimization

### Tool Architecture

The server exposes 18 tools organized by entity type with standardized naming convention using underscores (MCP-compliant):

**Task Management:**
- `todoist_task_create` - Creates new tasks with full attribute support
- `todoist_task_get` - Retrieves and filters tasks (with caching)
- `todoist_task_update` - Updates existing tasks found by name search
- `todoist_task_delete` - Deletes tasks found by name search
- `todoist_task_complete` - Marks tasks as complete found by name search

**Bulk Task Operations:**
- `todoist_tasks_bulk_create` - Creates multiple tasks at once for improved efficiency
- `todoist_tasks_bulk_update` - Updates multiple tasks based on search criteria
- `todoist_tasks_bulk_delete` - Deletes multiple tasks based on search criteria
- `todoist_tasks_bulk_complete` - Completes multiple tasks based on search criteria

**Comment Management:**
- `todoist_comment_create` - Adds comments to tasks with optional file attachments
- `todoist_comment_get` - Retrieves comments for tasks or projects

**Project Management:**
- `todoist_project_create` - Creates new projects with optional color and favorite status
- `todoist_project_get` - Lists all projects with their IDs and names

**Section Management:**
- `todoist_section_create` - Creates sections within projects
- `todoist_section_get` - Lists sections within projects

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- `todoist_test_connection` - Quick API token validation and connection test
- `todoist_test_all_features` - Comprehensive testing of all MCP tools and API operations
- `todoist_test_performance` - Performance benchmarking with configurable iterations

### Error Handling Strategy

Structured error handling with custom error types:
- `ValidationError` - Input validation failures
- `TaskNotFoundError` - Task search failures
- `TodoistAPIError` - Todoist API failures
- `AuthenticationError` - Token validation failures

### Performance Optimizations

- **Caching**: 30-second TTL cache for GET operations to reduce API calls
- **Cache Invalidation**: Automatic cache clearing on mutations (create/update/delete)
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time and runtime type checking

### Search Strategy

For update, delete, and complete operations, the server uses partial string matching against task content (case-insensitive) to find tasks, enabling natural language task identification.

### Bulk Operations Strategy

Bulk operations provide significant efficiency improvements by allowing multiple tasks to be processed in a single API call:

- **Bulk Create**: Accepts an array of task objects and creates them sequentially, providing detailed feedback on successes and failures
- **Bulk Update/Delete/Complete**: Uses flexible search criteria to identify target tasks:
  - `project_id`: Filter by specific project
  - `priority`: Filter by priority level (1-4)
  - `due_before`/`due_after`: Filter by due date ranges (YYYY-MM-DD format)
  - `content_contains`: Filter by text within task content
- **Error Handling**: Each bulk operation reports individual successes and failures for better debugging
- **Cache Management**: Bulk operations automatically clear relevant caches to ensure consistency

### Data Flow Pattern

1. **Request Validation**: Type guards validate incoming parameters
2. **Input Sanitization**: Validation functions check business rules
3. **Cache Check**: GET operations check cache first
4. **API Call**: Execute Todoist API operation
5. **Cache Management**: Update/invalidate cache as needed
6. **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with error codes

### Environment Requirements

- `TODOIST_API_TOKEN` environment variable is required and validated at startup
- Server exits with error code 1 if token is missing

### Testing Infrastructure

The codebase includes comprehensive testing capabilities:

**Unit Tests:**
- Jest configured for ESM modules with ts-jest
- Type guard unit tests in `src/__tests__/type-guards.test.ts`
- Test imports use TypeScript extensions (not .js)

**Integration Tests:**
- `src/__tests__/integration.test.ts` - Full API integration testing
- Requires `TODOIST_API_TOKEN` environment variable for execution
- Tests skip gracefully when token is not available
- Comprehensive testing of all MCP tools and API operations

**Built-in Testing Tools:**
- `todoist_test_connection` - Validates API token and connection
- `todoist_test_all_features` - Tests all tools (tasks, projects, labels, sections, comments)
- `todoist_test_performance` - Benchmarks API response times with configurable iterations

**Running Tests:**
- `npm test` - Runs all tests (unit tests always, integration tests if token available)
- `TODOIST_API_TOKEN=your-token npm test` - Runs with integration tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Runs tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage` - Runs tests with coverage report

### Code Quality

- ESLint with TypeScript rules and Prettier integration
- Strict TypeScript configuration with explicit return types
- No `any` types - proper TypeScript interfaces throughout

### Distribution

- Built as ES modules targeting ES2020
- Executable binary at `dist/index.js` with shebang
- Published as `@greirson/mcp-todoist`

### CI/CD and Quality Assurance

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline with multi-Node.js version testing (18.x, 20.x, 22.x)
- **Dependabot Integration**: Automated dependency updates with CI validation
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Linting and type checking enforced before commits
- **Release Automation**: Automated NPM publishing on version tags

### API Compatibility Handling

Due to evolving Todoist API types, the codebase uses defensive programming patterns:
- **Response Format Handling**: Uses `extractArrayFromResponse()` helper to handle multiple API response formats (direct arrays, `result.results`, `result.data`)
- **Type Assertions**: Strategic type assertions for API compatibility while maintaining type safety
- **Error Recovery**: Try-catch patterns for API signature changes
- **Flexible Response Parsing**: Handles both array and object responses gracefully
- **Testing Integration**: Built-in test tools validate API compatibility across different response formats

### Important Notes

- **Tool Names**: All MCP tool names use underscores (e.g., `todoist_task_create`) to comply with MCP naming requirements `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$`
- **Cache Strategy**: GET operations are cached for 30 seconds; mutation operations (create/update/delete) clear the cache
- **Task Search**: Update/delete/complete operations use case-insensitive partial string matching against task content
- **Due Dates vs Deadlines**: 
  - `due_string`/`due_date`: When the task appears in "Today" (start date)
  - `deadline_date`: Actual deadline for task completion (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **Bulk Operations**: Use bulk tools (e.g., `todoist_tasks_bulk_create`) when working with multiple tasks to improve efficiency and reduce API calls
- **Bulk Search Criteria**: Bulk operations support flexible filtering by project, priority, due dates, and content matching
- **Testing**: Use `todoist_test_all_features` after making changes to ensure functionality works correctly
- **Linting**: Always run `npm run lint -- --fix` after making changes to auto-fix formatting issues
- **Type Safety**: When TypeScript compilation fails due to API changes, use defensive type assertions with proper interfaces rather than disabling strict checking
- **Development Workflow**: For API response handling, prefer using `extractArrayFromResponse()` helper function over inline type assertions

## Development Roadmap

The codebase includes a comprehensive development plan in `todoist-mcp-dev-prd.md`:

**Completed Phases:**
- âœ… **Phase 1**: Testing Infrastructure (v0.6.0) - Comprehensive testing tools and integration tests

**Planned Future Phases:**
- **Phase 2**: Label Management System - Full CRUD operations for labels with usage statistics  
- **Phase 3**: Subtask Management - Hierarchical task management with parent-child relationships
- **Phase 4**: Duplicate Detection - Smart task deduplication using similarity algorithms
- **Phase 5**: Project Analytics - Comprehensive project health metrics and insights

All future development should use the testing infrastructure to validate changes and ensure compatibility.
